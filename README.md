## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My first time using Figma to get CSS properties and apply them.

I learnt that Github is a lot stricter about file paths:

The code below worked on local machine but didn't work on Github.
```html
<img src="/images/image-qr-code.png"/>
```

I actually had to change it to the code below so it could work:
```html
<img src="./images/image-qr-code.png"/>
```

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Grace-Snow who helped me figure out the path issue I was struggling.
